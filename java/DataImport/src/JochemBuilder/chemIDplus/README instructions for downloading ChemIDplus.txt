INSTRUCTIONS FOR FTP OF CHEMIDPLUS DATABASE

Access instructions are for NLM ChemIDplus licensees only; do not share directory or file names with others.  Be sure to use the IP address you registered with NLM.  All other IP addresses will be blocked from retrieving the files.

A full file replacement containing all new and/or maintained records will be on NLM's server on or shortly after the 28th of each month that such records are available.  The ChemIDplus updates occur at irregular and sometimes infrequent intervals.  A ‘ready’ file containing the number of records in the corresponding update file is also prepared.  The ChemIPplus DTD is also available on the server.

Ftp to NLM's anonymous ftp server; login as a non-fee/anonymous user; use your e-mail address as password; binary mode
ftp://ftp.nlm.nih.gov/nlmdata/.chemidlease/ (if using Netscape be sure to use the slash (/) at the end at the end of the sub-directory name)   
At the ftp prompt enter: get filename
Example: 
get chemid.dtd – for dtd
get chemid.ready – for record count in data file
get chemid.xml.20060428.zip – for the data file
Note that the date of the file update is reflected in the filenames (e.g., 20060428 is Apr. 28, 2006) 

A ChemIDplus factsheet is available from http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/factsheets.html and the database may be searched at NLM at http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemical.html.
